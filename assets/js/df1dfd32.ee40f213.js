You will\nprobably find that you spend more time here.\n\nOf course, you can decline and instead remain as a\ncontributor, participating as you do now.\n\nThis personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.\nPlease let us know in reply to this message whether you accept or decline.\n\n**If you accept, you will need an Apache account (id) with privileges.\nPlease follow these instructions.**\n\nA.
